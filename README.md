### Time Converter (12-hour to 24-hour)
This first Python script converts a time given in the 12-hour format to the 24-hour format. The conversion follows the convention where noon is represented as 12:00 pm, and midnight is represented as 12:00 am.
### Usage
Enter the hour (1-12), minute (0-59), and period ('am' or 'pm') when prompted.
The script will output the equivalent time in 24-hour format.
