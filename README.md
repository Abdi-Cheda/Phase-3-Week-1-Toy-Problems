## Time Converter (12-hour to 24-hour)
The first Python script converts a time given in the 12-hour format to the 24-hour format. The conversion follows the convention where noon is represented as 12:00 pm, and midnight is represented as 12:00 am.
### Usage
Enter the hour (1-12), minute (0-59), and period ('am' or 'pm') when prompted.
The script will output the equivalent time in 24-hour format.

## Exactly Two Positive Integers Checker
The second Python script defines a function that takes three integers (a, b, and c) as arguments and returns True if exactly two of them are positive numbers (greater than zero), and False otherwise.
### Usage
Enter three integers (a, b, and c) when prompted.
The script will output True if exactly two of the three integers are positive, and False otherwise.
