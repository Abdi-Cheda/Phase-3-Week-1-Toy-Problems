## Time Converter (12-hour to 24-hour)
The first Python script converts a time given in the 12-hour format to the 24-hour format. The conversion follows the convention where noon is represented as 12:00 pm, and midnight is represented as 12:00 am.
### Usage
Run the script in a Python environment.
Enter the hour (1-12), minute (0-59), and period ('am' or 'pm') when prompted.
The script will output the equivalent time in 24-hour format.

## Exactly Two Positive Integers Checker
The second Python script defines a function that takes three integers (a, b, and c) as arguments and returns True if exactly two of them are positive numbers (greater than zero), and False otherwise.
### Usage
Run the script in a Python environment.
Enter three integers (a, b, and c) when prompted.
The script will output True if exactly two of the three integers are positive, and False otherwise.

## Consonant Substrings Value Calculator
The third Python script defines a function that takes a lowercase string with alphabetic characters only, calculates the values of consonant substrings, and returns the highest value. Consonants are defined as any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou". The assigned values are a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, ..., z = 26.

### Usage
Run the script in a Python environment.
Enter a lowercase string with alphabetic characters only when prompted.
The script will output the highest value of consonant substrings in the given string.
